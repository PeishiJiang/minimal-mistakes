Hi, I'm a Ph.D. candidate from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My Ph.D. work is to understand the self-organization of an ecohydrological complex system by using information-theoretic approaches. Besides, my research interests also include frequency analysis of hydrological extremes, web service modeling and model integration in geoscience, the application of high performance computing in data science, and general data analysis approaches and their application in earth science.
