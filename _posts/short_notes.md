This post is aimed at recording any piece related to my research which jumps to my mind.

* Use **vaper pressure** rather than **relative humidity** in constructing the ecosystem network
  - Relative humidity, which is the proportion of the ambient vapor pressure over the saturated vapor pressure, is heavily dependent on the ambient temperature, and its temporal and spatial variations are thus close to that of temperature. Therefore, using relative humidity, along with ambient temperature, will result in strong correlations between the two in different lags, ambiguating the true relationship between vapor pressure and the temperature. 
  - The vapor pressure can be either measured or computed from the temperature and relative humidity, which could be calculated by using [Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron_relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation).
  - See Chapter 3.4 in <[An Introduction to Environmental Biophysics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780387949376)> for more details.
