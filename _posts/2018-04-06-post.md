My recent paper entitled "Interactions of information transfer along separable causal paths" is accepted by **Physical Review E**. The objective of this work is to characterize the information transfer from two lagged source variables on a target variable through causal paths, indicated by a time series graph. It is essentially useful in understanding the interactions among multiple lagged variables by excluding the influence of the historical dynamics in a complex system, and therefore will potentially have a wide application in various domains related to complex system analysis, such as ecosystems.
